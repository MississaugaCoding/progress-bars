Progress bars exercise

Requirements:

Clicking on the "Add" button adds a progress bar to the page.

The progress bars fill up gradually in sequence, one at a time, i.e. the next progress bar will only start filling up after the previous progress bar is completely filled up.

Each bar takes approximately 2000ms (two seconds) to completely fill up.
